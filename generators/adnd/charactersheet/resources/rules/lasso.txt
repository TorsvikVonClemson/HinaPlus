~~~Lasso~~~
Every attack requires a called shot. Legs forces the opponent to make a DEX check to escape or trip. Called shot arms forces the opponent
to make a STR check or be pinned, dis arming the opponent and giving a -4 to escape. Additional lassos are cumulative. An attempted
dismount does not require a called shot but you must make a contest of STR with the rider. If you win, the rider is dismounted and 
takes 1D3 dmg. If you lose, you hold of the rope and take 1D2 dmg as you are yanked foreward. Both results happen on a tie. If you
had the foresight to tie the rope to a stationary object the rider must make a Bend Bars/Lift Gates to break the rope. If you make
a called shot head you can yank for 1D3+Str dmg on the first round and 1+Str on each subsequent round. If you ar in a situation where
you can lift you opponent, say you hide in a tree and lift up an unsuspecting guard, You will cause 1D4 strangulation dmg per round.
Finally you can attempt to make a called shot head against a mounted rider. Make all of the checks mentioned before. If you lose the
Str contest the rider takes 1D4 and you take 1D2. If you win, you cause 3D6 dmg. Rope Use gives an additional +2 to hit.

There are alot of rules for the lasso and they are difficult to pull of but are extremely effective manuvers when successful.
