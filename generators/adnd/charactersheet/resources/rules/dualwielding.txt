~~~Dual Wielding~~~
Anyone can dual weild a weapon the size of a short sword or smaller. This grants an additional attack every round. Non Rangers do
suffer a -2 to attack for the main weapon and a -4 for the off hand. A good tactic is to add the second attack and dedicate it to
parrying, only swinging it when you are left with free attacks. You can also take a late initive and dedicate your attacks to negating
your opponents attacks and only attacking when you have attacks left over.
