~~~Net~~~
A netted character needs to make a STR check to escape. After the opponent is captured, the attacke can spend each round wrapping  the net reducing STR by 4 each round. A net must be properly folded to be used effectively. Throwing the net unfolds it and remains so until combat ends and the player takes time to fold it again. An unfolded net can still be used but at a -3 to attack rolls. A player can also use a folded nety to perform Parry and Disarms.
