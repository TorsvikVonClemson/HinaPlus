~~~Macabre~~~

Macabre is a measurement on your characters grasp on their humanity. As the character experiences scarring horrors they will become increasingly distrusting of their fellow man and detached from the rest of humanity. The character will gain a grim disposition but will have benefits. As a character gains macabre they will become increasingly brutal, making them powerful forces. Bonuses gained will differ by class, but understand that it is a slippery slope. Macabre is difficult to recover from and as it is gained it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid. Different races will experience macabre differently.

A Macabre check is Wisdom-Macabre. This means at a point you will always fail macabre checks. At 20 macabre the DM will take the character sheet as that character becomes a Creature of the Night.

Common examples of times when Macabre is checked:
-When an innocent dies
-When a party member dies
-Encountering Creatures of the Night

Common Examples when Macabre is given by DM without a check:
-A PC kills an innocent for profit
-A PC kills another PC
-Participating with or aiding a Creature of the Night

People staying in the Inn may also be subject to Macabre. This will generally happen in the event of a TPK or a specific event.
