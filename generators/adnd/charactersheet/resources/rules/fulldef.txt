~~~Defensive Options~~~

--Full Defense--
If you have a shield or cover (a bush, corner of a wall, book, get creative) you can go full defense by giving up all actions. The amount 
of defense gained is based on the amount of your body is concealed. The scale also takes into account soft cover (a bush) vs hard cover (a 
tree tunk). Bonuses are applied as such; -2/-1 for 25% cover, -4/-2 for 50%, -7/-3 for 75%, -10/-4 for 90%. Players also often forget that 
full defense also works on SAVING THROWS. You can go full defense to try and protect yourself from a fireball, lightning bolt or dragons 
breath. If you have 90% concealment all damage is reduced by an additional 1/2 even on a successful hit!This means a fighter with a body 
shield could reduce an Adult Red Dragon's fire breath from a devestating 18-126 Dmg to a manageable 5-32.

--Parrying--
If you are attacked you can give up one of you attacks to try to parry. When you choose to parry a blow you gain an AC bonus of half your 
level, +1 more if you're a fighter. Parrying with a shield smaller than a body shield provides an additional +2 bonus. If you have a weapon 
with reach you can parry attack on other members of the party. Parrying can be very useful in situations where the party is surrounding a 
single large creature such as a troll. Only able to attack one player at a time, said player can focus on parrying to negate its attack 
completly. Just keep in mind if you move before the opponent to ask DM who its attacking so you don't use up your attacks. Some weapons 
can disarm on a parry with a -8 to attack.
