~~~Scourge~~~
The scourge actually is a poor weapon but the damage it does cause is designed to be excruciatingly painful. Its designed like barbed wire to yank and tear the skin causing anyone hurt with it to make an immediate fear check. Unlike normal morale checks only the one hurt needs to take the check. If the character doesnt have morale (PCs) the check is roll 1D20 + CON mod, roll above the damage done. Fear in this case is not base in intimidation from the opponent but the reflex to escape the pain. The PC doesn't necessarily run away but they will be left flat-footed as they recoil in pain.
