~~~Morale~~~
In most cases, humanoids will choose to beat you with numbers rather than by skill. You can become very quickly ovewhelmed. I'm  revealing the situations for moale checks to encourage the players to strategise how to overcome superior numbers.

Humanoids (and some animals) must make a morale check when:
-They are suprised
-Faced by an obviously superior foe
-An ally is slain by magic
-25% have died
-50% have died
-Any ally is slain after 50% have died
-A leader is slain or deserts
-Fighting a creature it cannot harm due to magical properties
-Forced to do a heroic task
-Offered an adiquate bribe
-Offered a chance at surrender after havin already made a morale check
-Completely surrounded
