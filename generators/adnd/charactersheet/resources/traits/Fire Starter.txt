~~~Fire Starter~~~

“When you believe that the acolyte is prepared, teach him how to create fire. Don't teach him how to extinguish it”
-Excerpt from the Brass Codex

You can control fire equivalent to the strength of prestidigitation at will. You are immune to normal fires and get a +2 save against magical fires. You gain the language of the elementals.
