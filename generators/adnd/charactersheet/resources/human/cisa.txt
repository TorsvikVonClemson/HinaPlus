Cisa is the patron deity of adventurers, gamblers and all other risk takers. She is depicted as a golden haired women, clad in gold armour, heavily adorned in jewelery and gold. She does whatever she can to stack the odds in her favor. Trying to force luck as she does is very difficult, especially when compared to the miracles her sister produces. The two commonly get into fights as Cisa slowly increases the entropy of the universe. Hina accuses her of being near sighted and that forcing good fortune will lead to devastation. Never the less she is a far more popular deity as the miracle works she performs are less impressive it doesn't come with the caveat of the ominous "Unforeseen consequences". The faithful do have a strong code of ethics. Their methods may be seen as cheating, especially in the case of a supposedly fair game of chance, so they only use their powers against evil peoples. Generally greedy, how much wealth  you accumulate directly correlates to Cisa's favor. Keep in mind though, the faithful love the accumulation of wealth. They are neither miserly nor would they put someone in harms way for profit. They do however love any gamble and adventure, gladly tag along with and party with at least neutral intentions. Bonus points for forming the Ilmura, Tyr, Calandra and Cisa for all of your good hearted, high-adventure, zealous fun.

Festivals for Cisa are practiced with feasts, singing and church run horse races. Unlike their sister religion, the clergy of Cisa are not safe from the dangers of playing with fate. There are very real repercussions to their actions. Its not unknown for a cleric to cast a spell and the build up of poor fortune is released all at once. This has been known permanently curse nearby individuals to have poor luck for the rest of their lives. The church provides services to aid these individual and attempt to cure them, often times requiring extensive donations from patrons. The Hina clergy never fails to remind Cisa worshipers of a time when several clergymen gambled to raise donations, creating a plague of cursed commoners.
