Compared to the overbearing ways of Reueherr, the strict methods of Stafherr or the distubing practices of the unspoken eldest brother,
Tyr is a very well liked and sociable god. They are boisterous and loud, drinking deep from the chalice of life. The faithful of 
Tyr have a general plesant disposition that conceals a more grim belief. Those who follow Tyr believe that men are unlawful by 
nature and that the only way to find true law is on the battlefield far away from politicians and corrupt law enforcement. Only when 
a mans life is threatened is his true nature revealed. This is why the faithful to Tyr emphasize ettiquite and honor, the unspoken 
agreements of a man at war. Your life is short and disposeable, but not to be wasted. The faithful to Tyr are brutal, unrelenting 
and cunning in battle. You and your battle brothers are all cogs in the military warmachine.

It may be suprising to hear that when not on the warpath, the clergy of Tyr spend their time writing poetry, making art and enggaging
in philisophical debate. The commandments of Tyr are vague and open to discussion, a common debate would be, "Is it more horourable
to conduct a suprise attack knowing it would save lives?" It also commonly suprises people to find that the clergy of Tyr hate war.
In their opinion, no soldier goes to war. He is sent to war by his countrymen and lords who will never lift a sword in their lives,
much less have one pointed at their throat. You may not be able to stop the horrors of war, but you can try to make them less horrible.
