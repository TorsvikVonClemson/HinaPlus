While the four brothers of law bicker, the sisters of fortune fight, the twins of civilization sit around building models and Leuchtag lights things on fire, Calandra was guiding humanity. Calandra is the patron deity of humanity. All the gods exist as constructs who gain power from the desires and emotions of all creatures so Calandra created humanity to form a symbiotic relationship. The emotions of men feed the gods and the gods in turn grant powers to the faithful. The faithful of Calandra promotes the preservation of mankind (and demihumans if they prove to be beneficial). She is also the reason men cannot stand being held in any form of captivity. She has created a constant drive for independence and dominance because the only way humanity can guarantee its perpetuation is through asserting themselves in the world. Clergy members of Calandra have a great love of members of Tyr's clergy. They tend to form duos that run around performing good deeds and fighting off evil.

Many people have realized that there is a direct religious conflict in Rhunfaust. There is a church that represents humanity and its independence but the state supported church worships a dragon. Most laugh and shrug it off as an odd oxymoron but higher members of the church don't take the situation as lightly. The church has plans to orchestrate a coup against the church of Bahamut. They do however act with tact as Bahamut is the state sponsored god and its worshipers are known to be zealots. As it is still to the benefit of humanity, they choose to get along with members of the church but they're not against spreading seeds of doubt. Calandra drove men from their caves, guided them to freedom from the elves, sewed the seeds of rebellion against dragons and one day mankind will conduct the affairs of the world.
