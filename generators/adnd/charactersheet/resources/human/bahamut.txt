As a member of the oldest state religion your beliefs stand with the founding principles of the kingdom. Freedom from tyranny, perseverance and to uphold law backed by a strong moral fiber. A point of contention is that the preservation of holy objects is often held above the well being of the people. A faithful worshiper of Bahamut would not think twice about booting a farmer off his land if that land was on a holy site. Keep in mind you are the only state recognized church that worships an inhuman god. You consider your practices above the state and humanity. Bahamut guided your people to freedom before and he will not forget you if you stay faithful. Members of the clergy dress with a piscine theme, scale mail and a cassis crista helm. Remember, "The Gold Dragon Protects".

Many people nowadays feel that the Church of Bahamut should be proceeded with the word "Esoteric". The worship of Bahamut is the official state religion and its practices predate the kingdom of Rhunefaust. As the state religion they commonly play the role of tax collectors. That alone would irritate most peasants but add to that the fact that many of the clergy have been known to line their own pockets. They are also ethical hardliners. Not as strict as Strafherr, their position as official law keepers gains the contempt of the populace. It is a well kept secret that all ranking members of the clergy suffer from Gold Sickness. If you are a member of the clergy you must keep it secret. If you reveal you illness you will be excommunicated and dishonorably discharged as you are no longer mentally able to perform your duties and possibly executed for treason if you intentionally revealed the church's secret.
