~~~Always Festag~~~

You can declare any day a Festag. In order to do so you must prepare a feast (normal food consumed * 5 and 3 drink per person). Hosting a feast takes an entire day but it has 3 effects. The first effect is that if anyone in the party has gained 1 Macabre during this adventure, they will immediately recover it after a Macabre check. The second effect can only happen after successfully capturing a Lair. If you feast after capturing a Lair everyone may make a Macabre check to heal 1 previously gained Macabre in adition to Macabre gained during the adventure. This can only be done once per lair. The third only occurs after a Macabre healing event. In this case if a feast is held the amount of Macabre healed will be doubled. This does not include PC actions that heal Macabre.
