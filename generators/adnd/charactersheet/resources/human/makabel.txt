Clerics and the faithful to Makabel see life as suffering and death as release. They have come to terms with their mortality and commonly come off as morbid because of their casual approach to death. Worshipers recognize Makabel as the deity who decides when people get to die, because of this they avoid killing whenever possible. A cleric will always stay his hand if he believes his next strike will kill his opponent. Concerning resurrection, the cleric beseeches Makabel and asks him if it was the appropriate time form the deceased to die, the result foretelling his decision. They consider magical resurrection, resurrection performed by another god or undeath to be a cardinal sin. Members of the clergy undergo a ceremony on Makabel's holy day where they are given a blessed tattoo on the shoulder that activates upon the persons death. The blessing give the person a few moments of undeath where they can perform their own last rights. Every festival the tattoo is expanded upon. Experienced members will have a large intricate tattoo expanding as far as their feet.

Makabel is the deity of death and is most known for his role of escorting the dead to the afterlife after he has been summoned by performing last rights. Makabel is a large, imposing and mute figure. He is commonly depicted fully armored with a cloak draped over his amour and a tabard that lacks a family crest. Makabel's skeletal face is only ever exposed in graveyards which usually features several statues of him. Graveyards are commonly referred as "Makabel's Gardens" where he removes his helmet so he can watch over his land.
