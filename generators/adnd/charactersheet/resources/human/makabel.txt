Clerics and the faithful to Makabel see life as suffering and death as release. They have come to terms with their mortality and 
commonly come off as morbid because of their casual approach to death. Worshippers recognize Makabel as the diety who decideds when 
people get to die, because of this they avoid killing whenever possible. A cleric will always stay his hand if he belives his next 
strike will kill his opponent. Concerning ressurection, the cleric beseeches Makabel and asks him if it was the appropriate time
form the deceased to die, the result fortelling his decision. They consider magical resurection, resurection performed by another 
god or undeath to be a cardinal sin. Members of the clergy undergo a ceremony on Makabel's holy day where they are given a blessed 
tattoo on the shoulder that activates upon the persons death. The blessing give the person a few moments of undeath where they can 
perform their own last rights. Every festival the tattoo is expanded upon. Experienced members will have a large intricate tattoo 
expanding as far as their feet.

Makabel is the diety of death and is most known for his role of escorting the dead to the afterlife after he has been summoned by 
performing last rights. Makabel is a large, imposing and mute figure. He is commonly depicted fully armoured with a cloak draped 
over his armou and a tabard that lacks a family crest. Makabel's skelatal face is only ever exposed in graveyards which usually 
features several statues of him. Graveyards are commonly refered as "Makabel's Gardens" where he removes his helmet so he can watch 
over his land.
