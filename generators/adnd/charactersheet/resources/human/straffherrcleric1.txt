~~~Absolution~~~

“Sin is carried by the blood. The solution is simple. If we act soon we can siphon off the blood before it reaches the heart.”
-Quoted from The Alchemist. Lex Canon: Book of Alchemy and Spirit

You may flagellate a character to remove Macabre. The character must make a Macabre check to see if they heal and a system shock check to see how much the afflicted suffers. If the Macabre gained was during the last adventure with this character a passed system shock check does ½ max health in damage, a fail does max health in damage. If the Macabre is from an older adventure causes max health on a pass, death on a fail.
