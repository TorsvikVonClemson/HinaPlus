Reueherr is the youngest of the four brothers of law, generally depicted as a child. The faithful to Reueherr believe that absolution of your sins can only be gained through truthful apology. He directly opposes his elder brother, Strafherr, because his harsh ways force people into confession, any confession given to him is inherently a lie, compounding sin with more sin. The clergy, much like the gods themselves, get along well with Tyr's Clergy. Tyr views Reueherr's beliefs as idealistic and unobtainable but appreciates the optimistic view of the world. A cleric or paladin always aims to pacify their opponent rather than kill them outright. Its common practice to subdue your opponent, ask them to repent, disarm them and send them on their way. In the case of magic users you leave them restrained in a way that they cannot cast spells.

Faustic prisons are comparatively civil due to the presence of Reueherr clergymen. If you are imprisoned with several Reueherr worshipers as your wardens you can guarantee hot meals, a sanitary place to live and that and the knowledge that if any other warden mistreats you, they will probably end up in the cell next to you. There is one downside though, you will be preached at for at least an hour a day. More depending on your crime. Furthermore clerics will use their powers to force you to re-experience your crime several times until you truthfully feel guilt and repent. This method can be especially powerful on those who committed especially heinous crimes.
