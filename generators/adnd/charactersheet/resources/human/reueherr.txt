Reueherr is the youngest of the four brothers of law, generally depicted as a child. The faithful to Reueherr believe that absolution
of you sins can only be gained by truthfully apologising. He directly opposes his elder brother, Strafherr, because his harsh ways
forces people into confession and that any confession givin in fear is inherently a lie. Compounding sin with more sin. The clergy,
much like the gods themselves, get along well with Tyr. Tyr views Reueherr's believs as idealistic and unobtainable but apreciates
the optomistic view of the world. A cleric or paladin always aims to pacify their opponent rather than kill them outright. Its common
practice to subdue your opponent, ask them to repent, disarm them and send them on their way. In the case of magic users you leave them
restrained in a way that they cannot cast spells.

Faustic prisions are comparatively civil due to the presence of Reueherr clergymen. If you were imprisioned with several Reueherr 
worshippers as your wardens you can guarentee hot meals, a sanitary place to live and that and other wared who mistreats you will
probably end up in the cell next to you. There is one downside though, you will be preached at for atleast an hour a day. More depending
on your crime. Furthermore clerics will use their powers to force you to re-experience your crime several times untill you truthfully
feel guilt and repent. This method can be especially powerful on those who committed especially heinous crimes.
