Kolsten along with his twin sister Gerdora make up the gods of civilization. He is depicted in a variety of ways due to the large variety of professions he represents. In all cases he is shown being stern with long black hair, pulled into a ponytail, a thick walrus mustache and always engrossed in his work. He is the patron deity to all labor work including mining, lumbering and construction. He acts as the stalwart guard of work sites and, to an extent, service industries such as bars. You can guarantee that no one causes trouble if they see a tipsy paladin of Kolsten sitting at the counter. The faithful of Kolsten represent some of the main traits of the Faustic people, industrious, good natured, well mustached and if there’s no work to be done, probably full of liquor. Many non Dwarven foreigners wonder how people could worship a god of such menial duties but the faithful to Kolsten take great pride in their work. They see themselves as the foundation and unsung heroes of the kingdom. Though their home is on the work site its not too odd to see them adventuring. As a member of the clergy it is your job to make sure the work force can operate in peace. That often means entering the wilderness and stopping trouble before it happens. Make a note that Kolsten is only the foreman, he represents a plethora of gods and goddesses that each represent a profession. These gods usually have simple, ominous names based on their profession such as the god of waterway maintenance named The Dredge.

The colonization in the jungles have severely hurt Kolsten's twin sister's religion. They don't commonly speak about it but they have lost nearly 60% of their clergy. Members of Kolsten's faith have been largely supportive and have a tendency to speak out against the king after a night of drinking. In communities with a high number of Kolsten worshipers it has become common to dedicate most Festags to Gerdora.
