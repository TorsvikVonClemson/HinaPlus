Faithful worshippers and Clerics are thuggish in appearence and see themselves as protectors of the weak and helpless, much 
as a farmer who tends his crops. A cleric of Ilmura will never start a fight nor harm a sentient creature that isn't a threat. 
They strongly value personalities of fortitude, tolerance and indutriousness, prefering those who would rather burden a problem 
themselves and only asking for help when they cannot complete said task alone.

Ilmura is the diety of farms and feasts and is revered every Festag. She is described as an excepionally tall woman dressed 
in seasonal colours and foilage of seasonal crops. She is fair skinned with long red hair and smells of crops relevant to the 
season (fresh Kale in Spring, Peppercorn in Summer, Sweet Potato in Autmn and mustard and honey in Winter) During her Festival 
and during Festags that follow a bountiful crop, a celebration is held. For the celebration a woman matching her description 
is found and acts as host to the feast. The impersonator is placed on a 4 foot high chair. During the festival the impersonator 
takes requests for blessings from the towns people in exchange for their praise. This tradition originates from the belief that 
Ilmura makes an apperance in one village every Festag as a traveling mortal. Red heads are uncommon in Rhunefaust so its not 
rare for small towns to send scouts to larger cities to play the role of the goddess.
