Ilmura is the deity of farms and feasts and is revered every Festag. She is described as an exceptionally tall woman dressed in seasonal colors and the foliage of seasonal crops. She is fair skinned with long red hair and smells of crops relevant to the season (fresh Kale in Spring, Peppercorn in Summer, Sweet Potato in Autumn and mustard and honey in Winter) During her Festival and during Festags that follow a bountiful crop, a celebration is held. For the celebration a woman matching her description is found and acts as host to the feast. The impersonator is placed on a 4 foot high chair. During the festival the impersonator takes requests for blessings from the towns people in exchange for their praise. This tradition originates from the belief that Ilmura makes an appearance in one village every Festag as a traveling mortal. Red heads are uncommon in Rhunefaust so its not rare for small towns to send scouts to larger cities to find someone to play the role of the goddess.

Faithful worshipers and Clerics are thuggish in appearance and see themselves as protectors of the weak and helpless, much as a farmer who tends his crops. A cleric of Ilmura will never start a fight nor harm a sentient creature that isn't a threat. They strongly value personalities of fortitude, tolerance and industriousness, preferring those who would rather burden a problem themselves and only asking for help when they cannot complete said task alone.
