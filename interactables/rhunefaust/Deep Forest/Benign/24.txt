Guarded Gaming

The party hears a group of elven voices talking and laughing in the distance.

A group of elven rangers are sitting on the ground drinking and playing a cardgame. They invite the players to join.
One of the elves is a gaming expert. He says that he will offer a high value item if a player is willing to offer up his life in a bet.

Managing to beat the elf he will keep his word, giving up a scarab of protection.
