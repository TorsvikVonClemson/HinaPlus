Guarded Religion

The party encounters a weatherworn altar in the distance.

Immediately the altar appears to be dedicated to Bahamut. 

The religous will recognise it as a Draconic diety. Sacraficing gold (100 per player) to the statue will reward the party. Too little gold will grant a negative effect (Gold Sickness to the entire party). Whorshipper of Bahamut will want to desecrate the altar with no negative.
