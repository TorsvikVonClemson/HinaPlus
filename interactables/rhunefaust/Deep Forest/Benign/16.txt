Guarded Engineering

Crossing throught the hedges the party finds a pile of miscellaneous objects. This was likely the sight of a loot pile from a bygone war.

In the pile of rubbish an ENGINEER might find that this pile washed here from a now dreide up river. Following the river basin the party will come across a stone dilapidated bridge. Its keystone has ancient heraldry iengraved an could fetch a price if removed (ENGINEERING+5)
