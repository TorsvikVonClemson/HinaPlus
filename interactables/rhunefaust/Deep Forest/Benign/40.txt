Guarded Cobbling

In the distance you hear the complaints of a humanoid, shouting curses.

If the party seeks the humanoid he reveals themself to be an elf. He is throwing a tantum over his boot. He doesn't speek Faustic, in Sylvan though he states that his boots are not prepared for the festival coming up that night. A cobbler can guess how to fix the boots but with a +5 can improve them. Estatic he runs off to the woods, the next morning the player's boots will become winged boots. Failure and the elf reveals himself to be a level 10 warrior. He will attempt to beat the party to death with the boots.
