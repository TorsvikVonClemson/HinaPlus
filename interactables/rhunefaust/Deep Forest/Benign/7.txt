Trapped Brewing

While Travelling through a clear patch of the woods one of the players notices that the ground feels hollow.

Investigating revels a hidden pit with some barrels hidden beneath. The alchohol within the barrells is poorly brewed. If drunk it will cause the player to go blind after an hour. Returning it to town will bring devastating losses.
