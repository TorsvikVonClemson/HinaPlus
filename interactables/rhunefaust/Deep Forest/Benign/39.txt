Trapped Cobbling

In the distance you hear the complaints of a humanoid, shouting curses.

If the party seeks the humanoid he reveals themself to be a lost gypsie, their boot was damaged moving through the thicket. If a party member moves into a prone position they will suddenly attack, revealing themselves to be a vampire seeking easy prey.
