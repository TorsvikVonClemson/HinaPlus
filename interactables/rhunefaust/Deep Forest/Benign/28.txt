Guarded Armourer

The party is forced to traverse a thick layer of roots. One party member spots some armour entangled within.

An armourer has the markings of an soldier from a previous age. It has an obvious aura. A histoian or similar person would recognise it as a Dragon's Lieutenant. An armourer could restore it making it Field Plate +3. Failure creates cursed Plate of Vulnerability -3.
