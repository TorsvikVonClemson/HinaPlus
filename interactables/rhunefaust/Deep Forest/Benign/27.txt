Trapped Armourer

The party is forced to traverse a thick layer of roots. One party member spots some armour entangled within.

An armourer belives that he may be able to restore the armour, as it is pulled out much to the party's suprise it still contains the skeletal remains. Contract Trogden's Thwart.
