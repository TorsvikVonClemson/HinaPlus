Guarded Ancient History

The party encounters what appears to be a dilapidated building. You reckon it must be atleast 200 years old from a bygone era.

A Historian will identify it as an ancient outpost. Based on its location he can find a cache of weapons surrounding it are several traps (spear, rambo style). If they manage to get into the cache the players find a set of weapons intended for a long dead commander that never were recieved.
