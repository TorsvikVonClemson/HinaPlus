Trapped Ancient History

The party encounters what appears to be a dilapidated building. You reckon it must be atleast 200 years old from a bygone era.

A Historian will identify it as an ancient outpost. Based on its location he can find a cache of weapons, they are well preseverved and of some value. Unless the player passes by a significant value he wont realize that this is a cursed cache, cursed with Goldsmith's Rebuke.
