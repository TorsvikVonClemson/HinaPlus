Minor Gaming

The party hears a group of elven voices talking and laughing in the distance.

A group of elven ranges are sitting on the ground drinking and playing a cardgame. They invite the players to join.

They don't expect the players to put up anymoney but if they provide an interesting game they'll send some coin your way.
