While traveling through a thick patch of brush you hear the sound a small animals making panicked sounds.


If the players investigate the noise they will find an abandoned bear cub. If the players attempt to interact with it the will be confronted with a Brown Bear encounter. The cub will escape into the woods during the combat.
