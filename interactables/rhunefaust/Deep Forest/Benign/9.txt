Minor Ancient History

The party encounters what appears to be a dilapidated building. You reckon it must be atleast 200 years old from a bygone era.

A Historian will identify it as an ancient outpost. Based on its location he can find a cache of weapons, they are poorly preseverved but still of some value.
