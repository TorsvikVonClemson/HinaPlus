Trapped Reading/Writing

In a thicket a party member spots a corpse (weeks old) clutching a book.

If anyone can read they find the book to be and adventurer's diary. It describes a nearby location where some treasure was hidden. The treasure was the demise of the adventurer. Taking any of it curses the player with Luck Amok.
