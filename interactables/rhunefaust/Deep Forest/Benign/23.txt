Trapped Gaming

The party hears a group of elven voices talking and laughing in the distance.

A group of elven ranges are sitting on the ground drinking and playing a cardgame. They invite the players to join if they are willing to put up a value of atleast 20 gold.

If they player choose to play they will learn that one of the players is a dignitary. Furthermore, he's not very good at the game they are playing. If the player begins to win the elves will draw bows at the player, if the playerd doesn't take a dive they will fire on the player.
