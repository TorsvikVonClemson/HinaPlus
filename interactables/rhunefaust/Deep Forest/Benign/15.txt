Trapped Engineering

Crossing throught the hedges the party finds a pile of miscellaneous objects. This was likely the sight of a loot pile from a bygone war.

In the pile of rubbish an ENGINEER might find assortments of parts that can be re constructed into a water clock. No trap, just the tepmtation to carry the thing.
