Major Cobbling

In the distance you hear the complaints of a humanoid, shouting curses.

If the party seeks the humanoid he reveals himself to be a fairy, lamenting the loss of his boot. With a small amount of materiels a cobbler could fashion a new one. In return he will enchant the partys weapons with +1 for the rest of the quest.
