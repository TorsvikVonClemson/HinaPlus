Minor Pottery Treasure

You come upon what is a long since delapitated hous. The only thing revealing its past state is the now overgrown cobble stone floor. A few knee high piles of moartered stone still stand and a pile of rubble lay pressed against a tree.

If the rubble is searched with the Pottery you will come upon and old piece of small artwork. That appeared otherwise worthless. With a few hours of effort it can be restored to an item of value.
