Seamanship Trap

he party comes across a rare sight, a mansion ship. The stories say that dragons grabbed ship from the sea and threw them into the forests. The few that remained intact were converted into homes, usually for the wealth.

The building has been completely looted of any valubles. HISTORY or HERALDRY will say that this ship belonged to a noble that had betrayed the king. The sails and riggings astill seem to be in working order SEAMANSHIP can bring them back into working order, doing so will bring a DEATH KNIGHT back to stalk the world once more in a rage.
