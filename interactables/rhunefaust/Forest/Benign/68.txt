Guarded Mining Treasure

In the distance the party spots a stone statue, 8 ft tall.

The statue is of Kolsten, the god of labor. He stands over a a 5 ft deep gultch cut away by a small stream, arms crossed in waiting. MINING will reveal a platinum vein below the statue. If a player begins to mine it he will feel the severe need to continue, sweating profusely. The player will continue without stopping and will do so untill 20 lbs of ore are removed. Because of the players inability to rest he must make a CON check every hour. If a check is failed the player must make a system shock check or be struck dead (50dmg). At the end of the ordeal the ore evaporates back into the vein but at the feet of the player will be 10D10 magic stones (as per the spell) formed from the sweat of the character. Ther character will be too exhausted to act for the rest of the day. Characters with constitution of 20 will never stop striking the vein.
