Minor Seamanship Treasure

A gobblin runs around the woods in circles. He shouts alot of words in goblin (nautical terms)

He claims to be on a boat and lost his way SEAMANSHIP or NAVIGATION will help him on his way and he will reward the players with 2 Gold and offer the players to come aboard. If the player come aboard they will be whisked away onto hi boat, 10 years in the future. DO NOT ACCEPT HIS OFFERS TO COME ABOARD.
