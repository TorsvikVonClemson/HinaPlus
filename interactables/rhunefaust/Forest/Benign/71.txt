Pottery Trap

You encounter a section of wall that was once part of a mansion that fell over 100 years ago. Whats more impressive than the fact that this wall still stands but on the inner side there is a medium (or larger) art object, protected from weather by a still intact outcropping of celing.

If anyone looks deeply into this art object to judge it using POTTERY or APPRAISAL they will soon find themselves shrunk inside to the size of 1 ft.
