Guarded Healing Treasure

Along your way you slip in a trail of blood leading off to the side.

Following the trail you come across a wounded Dark Elf. She has been shot several times and the bullets need to be removed. She panics upon seeing the party and attempts escape. Approaching her causes her to weild her knif wildly. They party must sedate her and use HEALING to finalise the process taking a full day. On the following day if none of her posession have been stolen and she still lives a group of 1D4+1 Drow will arrive to retrive her. They thank the party for treating her by taking them to a secret stash where they arawd the party to an Adamantine Weapon of their choosing.
