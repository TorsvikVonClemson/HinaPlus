Guarded Animal Training Treasure

You encounter a wild animal (wolf?) while scouting a clearing.

On closer inspection (Animal Handeling) has unique markings. Wood Elves will immediately recognize it.

The creature is infact a demi god. Attempting to tame it will offend it causing it to take humanoid form fighting like a Werecreature. If the culture is well understood someone with ANIMAL TAMING can attempt to placate it. Pleasing the demi god will cause it to lead the party to its lair where it will allow the party to take a singe weapon/armour (not special, randomly decide +-)
