Minor Fire Building Treasure

In the distance the party spots a stone statue, 8 ft tall.

The statue depicts the god Leuctag, god of fire. He stands with his arms out streached, palms facing out. Before him is a large stone bowl. Creating a fire in the bowl using FIRE BUILDING will cast BLESS on the party.
