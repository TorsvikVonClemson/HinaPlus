Major Brewing Treasure

You come upon what is a long since delapitated house. The only thing revealing its past state is the now overgrown cobble stone floor. A few knee high piles of moartered stone still stand and a pile of rubble lay pressed against a tree.

Moving aside the rubble reveals a cellar. 
Exploring the cellar you find several barrels, most have been damage with age but one remains intact.

Inside is a 200 year old barrel of wine. The seal however is decaying and can be resealed with wax and the BREWING skill.
