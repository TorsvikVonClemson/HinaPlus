Major Dancing Treasure

You encounter a band of Wood Elves, they seem to be engaged in some kind of ritual.

They are in the middle of a dancing ritual, a Faustic speaking lord offers the party to participate. A Wood Elf would know the festival to be a benign celebration to the titans of the forest. If impressed they will praise the party offering food and drink. Should the party stay the night they will wake up the next morning, the elves gone and the parties clothing replace with expensive ceremonial attire valued at 100 Gold each (should the members exchange them for regular clothers).
