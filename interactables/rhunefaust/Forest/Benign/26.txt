Major Carpentry Treasure

You come upon what is a long since delapitated house. The only thing revealing its past state is the now overgrown cobble stone floor. A few knee high piles of moartered stone still stand and a pile of rubble littered with large chunks of wood lay pressed against a tree.

If examined using the CARPENTRY skill one of the large wooden objects will be revealed as a pew from a curch of [RELIGION] that may have stood here 200 years ago. Its heavy but it will fetch a fair price as a holy object.
