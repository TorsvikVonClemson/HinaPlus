Minor Tailoring Treasure

A small clearing is revealed under the presence of a large oak. The skeletal remains of a long dead traveler sit covered in cobwebs against the trunk as the traveler reached his final resting place clutching an arrow that was once embedded in his chest. His clothing, though weathered, is largely intacked. Probably preserved from the elements under the shelter of the oak.

Using Tailoring you notice that his cloak is of fine quality silk. You could easily restore it.
