Major Stonemasonry Treasure

The party comes across a rare sight, a mansion ship. The stories say that dragons grabbed ship from the sea and threw them into the forests. The few that remained intact were converted into homes, usually for the wealth.

It seems that this building has been mostly looted. If an houre is spent searching the ship with STONEMASONRY the player may find a secret seash of 4D6 Platinum buries in a wall.
