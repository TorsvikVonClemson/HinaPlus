Guarded Heraldry Treasure

You encounter a section of wall that was once part of a mansion that fell over 100 years ago. Whats more impressive than the fact that this wall still stands but on the inner side there is a coatof arms, protected from weather by a still intact outcropping of celing.

The Coat of arms appears to be of value but unless HISTORY or HERALDRY+5 is made the player will be cursed as it was the posession of a nobel that had betrayed Trogden. They collector will be cursed with Trogden's Thwart. If the coat of arms is destroyed, however the splinters can be taken to a priest of Bahamut and turned into an amulet making the wearer immune to dragon breath using the BLESS spell.
