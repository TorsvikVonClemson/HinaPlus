Major Healing Treasure

Along your way you slip in a trail of blood leading off to the side.

Following the trail of blood brings you to an invisable wounded Wood Elf. Their leg is broken and must be splinted. They react to you with fear and hostility. If the players go through with aiding the elf the elf will apologise by gifting the party a potion of invisabilty.
