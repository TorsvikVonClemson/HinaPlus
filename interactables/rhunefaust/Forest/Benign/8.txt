Guarded Animal Handeling Treasure

You enter a glade sparse of trees, you spot a lone horse grazing. It seems undisturbed by the party.

ANIMAL HANDLING identifies the horses as being very well bred and appears to be the possession of a nobel that has wandered away. The animals have however been rustled and returning the animals will cause the party to encounter the rustlers (Party level +2 difficulty). 

TRACKING, ANIMAL HANDELING+5, LOCAL HISTORY, DIRECTION SENSE, HERALDRY, NAVIGATION. Warns the party. 
The horses origins are unknown but one of the rustlers may be forced to answer leading them to the home of a lord who repays the party in kind (see below).

2. Roaming Waldgraf offers 100-400 Gold Pieces
3. Horse Lord gives the location and command word of a stone horse.
