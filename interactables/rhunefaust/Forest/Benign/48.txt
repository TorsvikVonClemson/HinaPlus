Guarded Etiquette Treasure

You come upon a band of humans resting in the shade of the forest.

Speaking to the they introduce themselves as a band of nobles seeking holy pilgrimmage in the forest. Thet offer the party to stay under their pavilion. If the party accepts the party will be attacked that night revealing the nobels to be vampires. If the nobles are impressed by a member's ETIQUETTE they will politely reveal themselves as vampires and inform the party of their original intention. Impressed by the glib of youth the offer the party a POTION OF GASEOUS FORM.
