Minor Ancient History Treasure

The party comes up to a cliff wall. Along it they spot some bizarre architecture.

There is a series of stone arches engraved into the wall. There are a bunch of symbols written in the colums in Draconic. Translate it basicly says "Kilroy was here".
Someone with ANCIENT HISTORY will recognise the symbols as a cache of weapon maintained by the rebel soldiers. Most of the weapon in the alcove are ruined with age but there is a small cache of gold 5D6.
