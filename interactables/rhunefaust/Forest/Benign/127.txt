Healing Trap

Along your way you slip in a trail of blood leading off to the side.

Following the trail you come across a noble barely concious and moaning in pain. His leg appears to be caught in a bear trap. What he actually is is a death knight, and releasing him actually releases him from his magical bonds. It take HEALING to rescue him.
