Major Mining Treasure

The party comes across a 5 ft deep gultch cut away by a small stream.

The walls of the gultch can be examined with MINING to reveal an exposed silver/gold vein. If equipped with mattoks the players can mine the ore. A player can mine 1 lb per OPEN DOOR per hour. The Raw silver/gold can be sold for 10s/10g per pound unless it is smelted (converts to coinage)
