Stonemasonry Trap

You encounter a Dwarven Caravan stopped to rest. They invite you over. 

Should the party sit with them they will challenge the players to a wall building contest. Should the players succeed they will be given as much money as they bet and may partake in the feast, minimum bet 100 gold. If the party does not have 100 Gold the Dwarves will allwo the players to bet their posessions. The Dwarves however will never be satisfied as the wall is not Dwarven enough. Should a Dwarf be the stonemason, the other party will declare the contest a draw.
