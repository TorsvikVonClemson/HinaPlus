Blacksmithing Trap

You come upon what is a long since delapitated house. The only thing revealing its past state is the now overgrown cobble stone floor. A few knee high piles of moartered stone still stand and a pile of rubble littered with twisted chunks of metal lay pressed against a tree.

What you haven't notice is that several of thos twisted metal chunks have severly rusted over and have developed ver sharp edges. You slice open you hand and you are lible to contract Tetnus.
