Rot Grub

A small clearing is revealed under the presence of a large oak. The skeletal remains of a long dead traveler sit covered in cobwebs against the trunk as the traveler reached his final resting place clutching an arrow that was once embedded in his chest. His clothing, though weathered, is largely intacked. Probably preserved from the elements under the shelter of the oak.

Attempting to interact with the corpse causes the player to interact with rotgrubs, !!!DO THIS IN SECRET!!!.
