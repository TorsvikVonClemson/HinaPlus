Guarded Engineering Treasure

In the distance the party spots a stone statue, 8 ft tall.

The statuer is carved in the likeness of TYR, god of war. he is in the middle of arming a ballista. With a pair of bowstrings the party can repair the ballista with ENGINEERING. If the ENGINEERING roll fails the player takes 1/4 of their max health as they lose a hand. A successful attempt shoots the bolt into a tree, in the tree the bolt has become the size of a regular arrow. The arrow itself is an ARROW OF LORD SLAYING.
