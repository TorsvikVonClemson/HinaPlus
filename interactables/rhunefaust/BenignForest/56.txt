Guarded Fishing Treasure

The pary enters a small glade, a pond glistens in the light.

Someone with the FISHING skill will recognise this place as a great fishing spot. There is a large fish that would make a great trophy. It requires FISHING +5 to catch the fish. Doing so pulls up a stone carp revealing it to be a holy pond to Bahamut. If released a CLOAK OF THE MANTARAY will float to the surface of the pond. If kept as a trophy the player will be cursed with Gold Sickness. If the player fails to catch the fish the player will be pulled under untill a successful Bend Bars/Lif Gates is performed by either the player or a compainon. Allow a reroll every round.
