Minor Brewing Treasure

Along a stream you find a strange brass and tin cauldron. There is a small coal fire heating the mechanism.

Someone with the BREWING skill will recognize it as a distilling tank for moonshine. The party can raise their spirits by tapping it and eat their fill of the mash (2d4 Food).
