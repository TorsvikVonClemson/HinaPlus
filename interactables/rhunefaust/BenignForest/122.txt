Major Engineering Treasure

While traveling the party finds a small glade to rest in. Not long after you hear the shouts of Orcs in the distance.

The Band of Orcs are busy having a fight, you can see amongst them a large trebuchet. They don't speak your language but they are more concerned with themselves than to speak with you. Apparently they had erected their trebuchet so they could thrown someone above the tree tops to get a sense of direction. Problem is they sent up the guy who knew how to work it. An ENGINEER can help them with their plight, they will reward you with hospitality and an orcish weapon of your choice.
