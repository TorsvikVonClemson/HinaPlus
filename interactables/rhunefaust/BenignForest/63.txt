Leatherworking Trap

Wandering through the woods you encounter a lone wood elf, they seem highly distracted.

The wood elf does not speak Faustic and is studying a broad piece of hide. He is trying to figure out how to work it into armour and wishes for advice from the party. If a party member attemps LEATHERWORKING the elf will be horrified by your act of barbarism. He accuses you with a curse, Enemy of the Wilds and runsinto a nearby tree.
