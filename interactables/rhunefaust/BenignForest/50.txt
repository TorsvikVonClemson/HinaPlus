Major Fire Building Treasure

In the distance the party spots a stone statue, 8 ft tall.

The statue depicts the god Leuctag, god of fire. He stands with his palms pressed together over a large stone bowl. Creating a fire in the bowl causes the statue to drop the hilt of a sword. The faithful can cause it to release a flame blade, 20 charges.
