Guarded Pottery Treasure

The forest clears to reveal a bizarre scene, 23 vases on pedastals stand in a circle.

Only one bust is true, touching the wrond one will cause them all to shatter releasing a gas. Inhaling the gas forces the player to take a save vs petrification or be turned to stone! Only after 3D6 hours of meticulous study will a player with POTTERY be able to notice that one is flawed. That is the true bust, taking it will cause the other busts to fade away.
