Trapped Weaving Treasure

A small clearing is revealed under the presence of a large oak. The skeletal remains of a long dead traveler sit covered in cobwebs against the trunk as the traveler reached his final resting place clutching an arrow that was once embedded in his chest. His clothing, though weathered, is largely intacked. Probably preserved from the elements under the shelter of the oak.

Using WEAVING you notice that the travelers cloak is of very high quality and likely of noble birth. Someone with ANCIENT HISTORY will recognise that this man had at sided against mankind and was likely cursed by The Liberator King Trogden, Makabel rest his soul. Taking any posession from this corpse will curse the player with Trogden's Thwart.
