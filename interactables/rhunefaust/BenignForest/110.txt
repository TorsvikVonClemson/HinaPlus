Major Weaving Treasure

A small clearing is revealed under the presence of a large oak. The skeletal remains of a long dead traveler sit covered in cobwebs against the trunk as the traveler reached his final resting place clutching an arrow that was once embedded in his chest. His clothing, though weathered, is largely intacked. Probably preserved from the elements under the shelter of the oak.

Using WEAVING you notice that the travelers cloak are very high quality and likely of noble birth. A historian could probably track down an ancestor and sell them for a moderate price.
