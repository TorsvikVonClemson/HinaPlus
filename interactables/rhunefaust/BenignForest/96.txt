Guarded Singing Treasure

In the distance the party spots a stone statue, 8 ft tall.

The statue is of the goddess Cisa, infront of her is a stone dias large enough for a single person to stand on. Its well known that the way to praise Cisa is by performing a song. Successfully completing the song, the goddess uses BLESS on the entire party for the remainder of their adventure. Should the performer be faithful to the goddess the will know the proper dance to perfor and will have a permenent blessing added to their wepon. Failure is the reverse cursing the party and if applicable, cursing the wepon.
