Major Seamanship Treasure

While traveling the party finds a small glade to rest in. Not long after you hear the shouts of Dwarves in the distance. (Nautical terms)

You come across a rare and bizzard sight, a dwarven land ship. 2D6 Dwarves are commanding a longship throught the ground. If approached the will explain that they were attacke and one of their members was killed. They would gladly let you hitch a ride if someone could use SEAMANSHIP to work their sails. Very grateful for the service they provide 2d6 food their hospitality and a vial of leftover liquid shadow, the substance that allows their boat to traverse the earth. The boat makes progress through the night.
