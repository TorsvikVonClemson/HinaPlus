Guarded Fire Building Treasure

In the distance the party spots a stone statue, 8 ft tall.

The statue depicts the god Leuctag, god of fire. His left arm is raised with his elbow bent 90 degrees, his right hand is holding the inside of his left elbow. Before him is a huge stone bowl. Building a massive fire with FIREBUILDING+5 will create a great white flame. The flame burns cold and heals all wounds lifts curses and cures disease and restores limbs. People emerge from the fire free of any scars or marks. 3 years of youth is also restored, but never too young to give stat negatives. Failure to build the fire curses the player with Leuctag's Embaressment.
