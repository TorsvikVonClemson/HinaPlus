Guarded Leatherworking Treasure

Much to the partys suprise ther is a lone Drow wandering the woods.

If she will allow the party to aproache her if cautious (CHA). She knows a little Faustic and expresses he confusion of the surface. She has three questions, one is for directions. One is for spare food. The final question is if the party can help her work a pelt she aquired. There is enough for two CLOAKS OF DISPLACEMENT, and if a party member can craft them using LEATHERWORKING+5 she will allow them to keep one. If failed she will be enraged, attacking the party with DROW POISON. After making the initial attack she will attempt to flee.
