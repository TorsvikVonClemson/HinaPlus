Minor Weaving Treasure

A small clearing is revealed under the presence of a large oak. The skeletal remains of a long dead traveler sit covered in cobwebs against the trunk as the traveler reached his final resting place clutching an arrow that was once embedded in his chest. His clothing, though weathered, is largely intacked. Probably preserved from the elements under the shelter of the oak.

Using WEAVING you notice that his cloak was modified with secret pockets. Opening them reveal a small stash of treasure 2D6 Platinum Pieces. Likely a stash of emergency wealth.
