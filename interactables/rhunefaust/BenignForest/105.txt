Minor Weather Sense Treasure

A gobblin runs around the woods in circles. He spots alot of words in goblin (nautical terms)

If approached he will change his language to whoever speaks with him. He uses alot of nautical terms and speaks nonsense but one thing is clear. He claims to be on a boat and needs to know the weather prediction, WEATHER SENSE will help him on his way and he will reward the players with 2 Platinum with making for a year 10 years from now. DO NOT ACCEPT HIS OFFERS TO COME ABOARD.
