Artistic Ability Trap

You encounter a section of wall that was once part of a mansion that fell over 100 years ago. Whats more impressive than the fact that this wall still stands but on the inner side there is a medium (or larger) art object, protected from weather by a still intact outcropping of celing.

If anyone looks deeply into this art object to judge it using ARTISTIC ABILITY or APPRAISAL they will soon find themselves to be a part of the object! The art object is cursed and only remove curse will free the entrapped.
