Astrology Trap

While traveling the party spots a lone Wood Elf wandering the woods.

If approached he is heavily dressed in furs and tribal object, he speaks you language fluently. He explains that he is trying to discern tomorrows wind direction. Attemptinh to use ASTROLOGY offends him and his gods. He curses the party to live in the rain. It will rain heavily for the duration of the adventure, halving travel speed and risking disease.
