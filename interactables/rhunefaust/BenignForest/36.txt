Guarded Cooking Treasure

You encounter a party of Ogres and Oni sitting and laugghing cooking a meal.

The goup of Ogre are not really interested in allowing the party to stay but will compramise if night fall is near. They will say that the do not have nearly enough food nor a suitable chef. The party may cook them a meal but the Ogres are less concerned with quality as they are with quantity. The party must cook a minimun 20 days of their own food inorder to satisfy them. If satisfied the Oni will give the party 1D4 potions of Vitality. If not satisfied, they will attack the party in hunger.
