Guarded Brewing Treasure

Along a stream you find a strange brass and tin cauldron. There is a small coal fire heating the mechanism and one of the tanks bears the seal of some noble.

Someone with the BREWING skill will recognize it as a distilling tank for moonshine. The party will find however that the spoils of the tank have already been plundered. 

Anyone with the TRACKING skill will notice that the distillery has been previously disturbed. Following the tracks will bring the party to an enemy party (difficulty+1) who have stolen their fill. The moonshine can be retrived and returned to the site for a hefty reward (1d6 gold). 

Should the party stay at the site empty handed a group of soldiers will arrive (difficulty +2) and attack the tresspassers.
