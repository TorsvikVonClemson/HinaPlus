Minor Mining Treasure

The party comes across a 5 ft deep gultch cut away by a small stream.

The walls of the gultch can be examined with MINING to reveal an exposed iron/copper vein. If equipped with mattoks the players can mine the ore. A player can mine 1 lb per OPEN DOOR per hour. The Raw iron/copper can be sold for 10i/10c per pound unless it is smelted (converts to coinage)
