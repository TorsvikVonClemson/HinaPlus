Engineering Trap

While traveling the party finds a small glade to rest in. Not long after you hear the shouts of humans in the distance.

A band of humans are disorganised and fighting. If approached they will claim that they were going to seige some of the buildings in the abandoned cities but their caravan traveled too fast and they broke a wheel on their seige ram. An ENGINEER can fix it in exchange for their hospitality. The bandits will seige the players hometown if their weapon is fixed.
