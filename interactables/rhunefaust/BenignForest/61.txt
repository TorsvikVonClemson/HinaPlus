Minor Leatherworking Treasure

You come upon what is a long since delapitated house. The only thing revealing its past state is the now overgrown cobble stone floor. A few knee high piles of moartered stone still stand and a pile of rubble and abandond clothing lay pressed against a tree.

If examined using the LEATHERWORKING skill and ornate leather belt will be found.
