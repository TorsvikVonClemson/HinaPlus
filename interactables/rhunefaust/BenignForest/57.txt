Minor Heraldry Treasure

You come upon what is a long since delapitated house. The only thing revealing its past state is the now overgrown cobble stone floor. A few knee high piles of moartered stone still stand and a pile of rubble lay pressed against a tree.

If examined using the HERALRY skill the pile of rubble will be found to conatin an heirloom in the form of an art object
