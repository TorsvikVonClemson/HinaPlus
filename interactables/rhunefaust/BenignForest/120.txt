Guarded Astrology Treasure

In the distance the party spots a stone statue, 8 ft tall.

The statue is of Makabel, god of death. He is surrounded by 22 stone humans of regular height, varying age and each has a plaque with a name and date inscibed on it. Their backs are all turned to Makabel. Makabel is poised sword ready to strike and at the base of his statue is several handles. It appears that you can rotate the statue. ASTROLOGY can discern which person is supposed to die on that day. If rotated to the corrcet person the statue of Makabel will strike them down, releasing a Holy +1 Zweihander. If the wrond statue is cut down then the party member who rotated the statue ages 10 years and must make a system shock test.
