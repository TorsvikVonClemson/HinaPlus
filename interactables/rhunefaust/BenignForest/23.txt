Brewing Trap

Along a stream you find a strange brass and tin cauldron. There is a small coal fire heating the mechanism.

Someone with the BREWING skill will recognize it as a distilling tank for moonshine. The party can raise their spirits by tapping it and eat their fill of the mash (2d4 Food). 

The brew however, is very toxic. Someone with the HEBALISM or BREWING+5 skill will recognise hemlock growing up stream and has likeley tainted the brew.
