Dancing Trap

You encounter a band of Wood Elves, they seem to be engaged in some kind of ritual.

They are in the middle of a dancing ritual, a Faustic speaking lord offers the party to participate. A Wood Elf would know the festival to be a celebration to the titans of the forest filled with debautchery and bloodlust. If impressed by a member with the DANCING skill and elf will become smitten with the player and be taken away, never to be seen again. Should the player fail the elves will be enraged and will attempt to hunt the party.
