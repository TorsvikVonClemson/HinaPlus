Guarded Ancient History Treasure

The party comes up to a cliff wall. Along it they spot some bizarre architecture.

There is a series of stone arches engraved into the wall. There are a bunch of symbols written in the arches in Draconic. Translated it lists a name over evey arch.
Someone with ANCIENT HISTORY will recognise the symbols as names above tombs. If the player passes by +5 he will notice that one tomb has the name of a rebel over it. He only needs to pass normally if he reads Draconic. The rebels tomb is empty, save a Tomb of Leadership
