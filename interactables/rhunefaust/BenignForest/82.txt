Major Rope Use Treasure

The party comes up to a cliff wall. Along it they spot some bizarre architecture.

Embedded in a wall is a massive stone cyllander. There is a very taught rope as if it was holding up a massive weight, one end is tied to the wall, the other suspends the cyllander. Only ROPE USE can untie the rope causing the Cyllander to spin with massive force to the other side where there is a cache filled with 10D10 silver pieces.
