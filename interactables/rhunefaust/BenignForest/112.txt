Guarded Weaving Trap

You encounter a section of wall that was once part of a mansion that fell over 100 years ago. Whats more impressive than the fact that this wall still stands but on the inner side there is a tapestry, protected from weather by a still intact outcropping of celing.

If anyone looks deeply into this art object to judge it using WEAVING, ARTISTIC ABILITY or APPRAISAL they will soon find themselves to be a part of the object! The art object is cursed and only remove curse will free the entrapped. Magic sense will detect that it is cursed, removing the curse will change the object into a flying carpet.
