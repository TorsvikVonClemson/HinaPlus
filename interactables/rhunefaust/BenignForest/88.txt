Guarded Seamanship Treasure

The party comes across a rare sight, a mansion ship. The stories say that dragons grabbed ship from the sea and threw them into the forests. The few that remained intact were converted into homes, usually for the wealth.

The building has been completely looted of any valubles. HISTORY or HERALDRY will say that this ship belonged to a group of pirate that backed the king. The sails and riggings astill seem to be in working order SEAMANSHIP+5 can bring them back into working order, doing so will bring the dead crew back to the land of the living. If impressed the Captain will give his fiddle to the party, if played by a musician it can be directed at a single intelligent being and be afflicted with Tasha's Uncontrollable Hideous Laughter and Otto's Irresistable dance. The player must continuously play the instrumment for it to be effective. If the captain is not impressed he wil call fourth an army os Sea Zombies to attack.
