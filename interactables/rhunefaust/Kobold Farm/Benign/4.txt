Swamp Whiskey

The Party walks along the walkways, in passing you notice several corks tied to strings suspended in the water.

The strings denote the locations of cold brewed Swamp Whiskey made of Muck Root. BREWING will tell you which ones are ready to drink.  Swamp Whiskey seems very filling butdoes not actually nourish you. Drinking it ignores all hunger negatives for a day but will not prevent death. (1D3)
