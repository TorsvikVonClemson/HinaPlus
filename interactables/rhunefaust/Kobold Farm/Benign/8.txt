Cave Lobster

Among the creeking of the floorboards you hear the water suddenly become disturbed as several small creatures swim away.

FISHING here with a net will net you a Cave Lobster. It will make a great exotic pet or a small meal. Don't let it pinch you. Some dwarves like cave lobsters for their beauty.
