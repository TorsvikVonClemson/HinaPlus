Gnomeblight

The Party walks along the walkways, in passing you notice several corks tied to strings suspended in the water.

The strings denote the locations of cold brewed Gnomeblight made of Kobold Bulbs. BREWING will tell you which ones are ready to drink. Kobolds find this to be both a delicasy and a leathal poison to Gnomes. Only Koblods seem to be able to handle its taste though and is one of the few things they will purchase for a high price.
