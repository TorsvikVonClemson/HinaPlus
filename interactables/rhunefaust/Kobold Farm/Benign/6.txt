Sewer Brew

The Party walks along the walkways, in passing you notice several corks tied to strings suspended in the water.

The strings denote the locations of cold brewed Sewer Brew made from Rat Weed. BREWING will tell you which ones are ready to drink.  Sewer Brew has the distinct ability to make the imbiber extremely photosensitive. For the next ten hours after drinking you have perfect infravision but you cannot see in any lighting condition above torchlight.
