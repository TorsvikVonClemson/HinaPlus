Major Cooking Treasure

Traveling through the tunnels you encounter a patch of subterranean vegitation you must traverse.

COOKING reveals the patch to contain Quarry Bushes, enough for 2d6 bags of leaves (for Dwarven Tea, 50 GP a bag) and 1 jar of Dwarven Quarrynut butter. (only 5 gp but 5 days of food)
