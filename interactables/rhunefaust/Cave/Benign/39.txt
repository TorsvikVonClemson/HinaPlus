Fishing Trap

You enter an open cavern filled with an underground lake.

Someone with the FISHING skill will recognise this place as a great fishing spot. If the player has a fishing hook, gain 2D6 food. 6D6 if the player has a net. What the fisher doesnt realise is that the lake is also filled with GIANT SPONGES. The agressive sponges leap out of the water and land on the party membr attempting to suffocate him.
