Blacksmithing Trap

You come across a large hollowed out section of the cave, within there is a large mechanism used for metal processing

You can spend an hour with blacksmithing to get the smelter running again creating 3D6*1000 IP in ingots. The chimney however is blocked flooding the area with smoke. Even if the machine is shut off the smoke will linger for up to 24 hrs and attract a lot of attention.
