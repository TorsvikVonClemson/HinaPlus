Guarded Fire-Building treasure

You enter an open cavern, one wall is mostly flat with something painted on the wall. Its too lage to see with somthing a megar as torchlight.

Upon lighting up the area the scene of a Leuchtag standing over a fire. If Firebuilding succeds by 5 then the image of the fire will burn away. Revealing the hilt of a blade on an altar.
