Minor Etiquette Treasure

In the distance you hear the ramblings and shufflings of a humaniod.

You encounter a lone Kobold. He is dressed as a priest of the White Rat. He jitters some things at you in an inexplicable language. With ETIQUETTE you know how to approach someone of his stature. After scattering some breadcrumbs on the floor for him  he blesses the party. {ask jake}
