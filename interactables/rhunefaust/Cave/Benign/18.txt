Major Cobbling Treasure

In the distance you hear the ramblings a shufflings of a humaniod.

Approaching the creature you find it to be a gobling, who panicked says he wants no trouble. Just a new pair of boots, his old ones are bad. If you can repair his old ones with COBBLING he will be estatic and give the party a bag of 3D10 blessed stones.
