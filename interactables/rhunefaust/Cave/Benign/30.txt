Major Etiquette Treasure

In the distance you hear the ramblings and shufflings of a humaniod.

You encounter a lone Dwarven prospector, he has made his way into these caverns to prospect possible dig sites. With ETIQUETTE you can show him the proper respect, deeply bowing and saying the proper Dwarven phrase, "May you mattock feel the soft klang of gold". He criticises your accent but apprciates the gesture. He offers the party to sit and drink with him as he would appreciate the company. If the party stays and talks with him he will offer the party a spare OIL OF SLIPPERYNESS. Apparently prospectors use it on their pickaxes to probe into the rock.
