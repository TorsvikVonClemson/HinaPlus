Cobbling Trap

You see a pair of boots hanging from the celing, they appear to be of some value.

Its tough to yank them doun but as soon as you do you realise in horror that in some way they have become integrated with the stability of the cavern. Run or rocks fall. You must dig through the rock to continue the adventure. 200 STR hours. Shovels provide a X2, Pickaxes X3. Mining reduces the time to 50 STR hours.
