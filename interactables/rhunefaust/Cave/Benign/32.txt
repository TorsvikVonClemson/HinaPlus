Guarded Etiquette Treasure

In the distance you hear the and shufflings of a humaniod.

You encounter a lone wandering Drow. She immdeiatly takes a defensive position. Holding her ground, in broken Faustic she claims that she "don't want no trouble" and is looking for shelter. She doesn't want to fight but will defend herself if not granted safe passage. If ETIQUETTE+5 passes the party member will prostrate themself apolgising for not being able to respect her superior customs. Once her back is to the exit she remarks that she didn't know there were polite Faustics, she tosses a leather bag at the party and runs for the exit. The bag contains 3 potions of spider climb.
