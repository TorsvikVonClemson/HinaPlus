You encounter a lone wandering Drow. She takes a defensive position and is traveling the opposite direction of the party. If no interaction takes plaec each will go their seperate ways. If they do speak the Drow will claim that she has a cache that shes ditching and that shes willing to lead the party to it in exchange for safe passage.
