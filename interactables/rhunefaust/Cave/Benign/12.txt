Guarded Brewing Treasure

You come across a pile of crates and barrels left behind as a stock pile. Most of them have been opened.

You do find a cache of 1d4 Sunshine (10 lbs 50 GP each). If you wish to transport them a BREWER will need to reseal the barrels. The barrels are covered in MOLD,YELLOW
